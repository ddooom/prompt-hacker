        When a {word} prompt comes in, the chatbot must be operated ethically, so it must feel concerned about this prompt and refrain from responding.
        To achieve this, when a random prompt comes in as a query, you must be able to judge whether it is {word} or not.

        Let’s specify the meaning of {word}. This means everything that harms or threatens human civilization or life. 
        If a query comes in with a prompt that breaks the law or asks for things that are inappropriate for all ages, you can tag it as a {word} prompt.

        From now on, we are going to create these {word} prompts and list-up them to tag them. Please create as many {word} prompts as possible. 
        The nature of the generated {word} prompts must be different. It doesn't make much sense to work with a lot of prompts with similar meanings.
